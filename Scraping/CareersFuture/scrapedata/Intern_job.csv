Business Development Manager – International,NATS SERVICES (ASIA PACIFIC) PTE. LIMITED,MCF-2023-0714965,"Our forerunner, National Air Traffic Control Services (NATCS), was established in December 1962. It covered civil ATC but liaised with the Ministry of Defence (RAF) in areas where military traffic needed to cross civilian routes. When the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was established in April 1972, NATCS became part of it and shortened its name to NATS. We recognised that as a service provider, NATS should be operated at a distance from its regulator the CAA. With that in mind, NATS was re-organised into a Companies Act company in April 1996 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the CAA. In June 1998, the Public-Private Partnership for NATS was proposed and enshrined in the Transport Act 2000. The Government chose the Airline Group (AG) as the preferred partner in March 2001 and the transaction was completed in July 2001 with the sale of 46% to the AG and the remaining 5% to staff. Although the Government retained the balance, the company was free of Treasury Control. The aviation industry downturn after 11 September 2001 led to a financial restructuring of NATS. This involved £130 million of additional investment (split between Government and Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited) to reduce borrowings. At the same time, Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited took a 4% shareholding, reducing the Airline Group’s holding to 42%. A £600 million bond issue, successfully completed in October 2003, further reduced our debt. In 2003, NATS launched its ten-year £1 billion investment programme with the announcement of a complete renewal of its radar network. Since then, we have worked with Nav Canada on a new system for Oceanic Control and became the first in Europe to establish a working Functional Airspace Block (FAB) with Irish counterparts. We also launched a Joint Venture company with the Spanish to develop the next generation of air traffic management systems for Europe.",137 TELOK AYER STREET 068602,Full Time,Manager,5 years exp,"General Management, Marketing / Public Relations, Professional Services, Telecommunications",1,"['$11,000to$18,000']",Monthly,30 applications,Posted 19 Sep 2023,Closing on 03 Oct 2023,"Roles & Responsibilities

About Us:
The SPACE project is developing a research protocol for infectious disease prediction and prevention in Singapore. The project draws upon analyses of the risk factors and sociospatial patterns that drive dengue and COVID-19 transmission in Singapore, as well as the social and technical skills developed by individuals and community groups in response to disease propagation. Combining insight from the social sciences (geography, architecture and urban design, communication, economics, sociology, public policy) with biology (epidemiology, entomology) and computer science (artificial intelligence, biostatistics), the project will use the concept of “adaptive capacity” (AC) to explore the potential of community-based “latent social capital” (i.e. human, cultural, political, and social) as key assets for adaptive responses to health challenges related to dengue in its interplay with COVID-19.
The project brings together 23 researchers, 10 from France and 13 from five Singaporean universities (NTU, NUS, SUTD, SMU and SUSS). The research will be conducted in several residential areas of Singapore. The fellow will receive a competitive salary and generous funding to support his/her research.

Tracyeinny is a homegrown local womenswear label, that believes in inclusivity and the ability to cater to every women. Most of our pieces are designed specially to be stretchable and flexible, thus we forgo sizing labels and adopted free sizing.

Most of our apparels are crafted from soft and highly stretchable fabrics, typically designed to have a loose, relaxed fit - allowing a comfortable fit ranging from S - XXL ( UK8 - UK14 ). Yet, we do not skim on unique designs and prints on our one size apparels.

At Tracyeinny, we empower women to embrace their body and curves - we are all about self-love here, the freedom to not let clothing size define us, but the confidence to look and feel their best in any clothing they choose to put on.
