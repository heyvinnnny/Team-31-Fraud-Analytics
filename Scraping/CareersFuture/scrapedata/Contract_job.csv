"Executive, Finance (Contract - 3 months)",SINGAPORE SWIMMING CLUB,MCF-2023-0728167,"Singapore Swimming Club started when a small group of young swimming enthusiasts got together at the end of 1893 to start a swimming club. Little did they know that they were laying the foundations for a premier club of the twenty-first century. The Club started operating out of a dilapidated hut by a sandbar in 1894. That hut was later abandoned when a more suitable clubhouse was found – a bungalow with a beach front. The site on which that bungalow stood was to become the site on which our present Club stands today. Over the years, the Club overcame the social and political changes prevalent at the various points in its history. Internally, there was the issue for equality, first for European women, later for Asians. Politically, changes in the Club’s constitution had to be made as Singapore transformed from a British colony to a self-governing state. The physical environment had also undergone sweeping changes. In its early days, the Club was situated in an idyllic beachfront. By 1930s, the Tanjong Rhu area was turning into an industrial area and the shipyards were polluting the sea. In the 70s and 80s, the government decided to turn the area into a residential area. The shipyards, sawmills and flour mills moved out progressively. Then with land reclamation, the Club lost its seafront but gained 96,436 square feet of reclaimed land to expand the Club. After nearly a century of ground shifting, the Club found itself settled on 3 hectares of freehold land nestled between luxurious condominium blocks in an exclusive residential district, just 6 km from the city centre and a 15-minute drive from Changi International Airport. The renovated Administration Building of the Singapore Swimming Club was officially opened on 27 February 2001 by the then President of Singapore, Mr S R Nathan. On 14 April 2002, the foundation for a modern mega club was built when the relevant authorities approved the renewal of lease where the Sports Centre is situated, paving the way for the next phase of development: a state-of-the-art sporting facility. Today, Singapore Swimming Club stands as a premier club, owned and run by members. The membership profile today is cosmopolitan, reflecting where we are at in the country’s social and political and economic history. Over the years, the Club has nurtured the qualities of care and concern and has positioned itself as a “Family Club”. These have been incorporated into its wide milieu of sporting and social activities.",45 Tanjong Rhu Road 436899,Full Time,Executive,3 years exp,Accounting / Auditing / Taxation,1,"['$3,000to$3,500']",Monthly,0 application,Posted 22 Sep 2023,Closing on 22 Oct 2023,"Roles & Responsibilities
