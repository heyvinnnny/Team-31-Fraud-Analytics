Digital Marketing Manager,NAUTILUS LABS PTE. LTD.,MCF-2023-0609765,"Nautilus Labs is advancing the efficiency of ocean commerce through artificial intelligence. With hubs in New York and Singapore, the firm is trusted by clients across the globe to help make better, real-time decisions that ultimately unlock transformative outcomes—at sea and on shore. By partnering with Nautilus, ocean shipping leaders can maximize returns for every vessel and voyage while driving cross-team collaboration, greater transparency, and stronger accountability for their companies, shareholders, and the planet we all share.","MARINA ONE WEST TOWER, 9 STRAITS VIEW 018937","Part Time, Permanent",Manager,5 years exp,Marketing / Public Relations,1,"['$5,500to$7,000']",Monthly,34 applications,Posted 11 Sep 2023,Closing on 11 Oct 2023,"Roles & Responsibilities
About Nautilus.
Nautilus is building artificial intelligence to advance the efficiency of ocean commerce. We deliver technology to help shipping companies minimize fuel consumption, maximize operational efficiency, and optimize fleet performance. By arming ship owners and operators with real-time predictive decision support, Nautilus is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and making global trade sustainable.
Ocean shipping consumes over $100 billion dollars of fuel every year, and up to 30% of it can be saved. For owner-operators, reliance on manually collected and analyzed data makes it difficult to optimize fleet performance in real-time. By providing a unified data platform that leverages machine learning, Nautilus helps its clients make better decisions to maximize the return on each ship and every voyage. For our clients, this means they drive closer collaboration, greater transparency, and stronger accountability across their global teams every day.

About You.
You’re not looking to work in an established corporate company. You don’t want to be a cog in a machine. You relish the challenge of working at a scale-up where you have to work out how to solve the problems facing you.
You want to work at a mission-driven company that is making a genuine difference to the world. You care about the environment and you’d feel proud to know you’re helping reduce carbon emissions in the shipping industry. As a bonus, you know a bit about the maritime sector, or you’ve got an interest in the ocean.
You love all aspects of digital marketing, and like the variety it offers, especially in a scale-up. You like the fact that you’ve got a huge number of different things to do, and that you’re the one who can decide how they get done.
But in particular, you’ve got experience running effective paid media campaigns; developing and implementing SEO strategies; managing organic social media; and reporting on the real impact of all marketing activities.
You blend an analytical, numbers driven approach with a creative mindset. You’re equally happy creating a marketing report as you are drafting a social post or creating a graphic. But you’re also more than willing to try your hand at whatever needs doing to solve the immediate problem, even if you don’t have the experience.
You’re very happy working as part of a team, but being responsible for your specific tasks. You get satisfaction from being given a problem to solve without always being told how to solve it.

Outcomes For The Role.
Develop and implement our website’s SEO strategy to increase relevant traffic
Manage our paid social and PPC activity to increase awareness and increase conversions
Create organic social media posts and manage our organic social media channels
Create social media graphics using existing templates
Manage our marketing reporting and analytics through Hubspot and Google Analytics
Maintain the website, ensuring the site is optimised for SEO and conversions
Provide local marketing support where needed
Manage our conversion tracking using Google Tag manager, Dealfront and Hubspot
Proficiencies.
5+ years of experience in digital marketing for a B2B company, ideally at the start-up or scale-up stage
Fluent English speaker with flawless writing skills
Demonstrable experience of managing SEO for a B2B company
Very good writing skills in a range of formats, from social posts to blogs
Experience using Hubspot, especially the reporting and analytics features
Experience of the entire Google product suite, especially Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and Google Ads and Google Search Console
Deep experience with SEMRush or equivalent (Ahrefs)
Experience of running LinkedIn and Twitter advertising campaigns generating demonstrable ROI
Certified in Google Ads and Google Analytics
Some experience of graphic design software such as Figma or Adobe Photoshop
BONUS: Maritime industry experience or exposure!
Our Core Values.
Get ready to join a group of diverse, smart, talented, and driven individuals. We are looking for people who are motivated by environmentalism and a future where shipping is sustainable and safe. A team member joining Nautilus is...
We’re THOUGHTFUL, with a bias towards action.
We’re an INCLUSIVE crew, and we are not passengers along for the ride.
We’re DIRECT and we ask the tough questions.
We EMPATHIZE with humanity.
Location: Singapore [Hybrid].

Who we are

We do this by curating and developing influential trade and consumer events for key industries and sectors, connecting people, global marketplaces and networks for sustainable growth.
Learn more about us at constellar.co. 
  What it’s like to work here
Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions, or MICE, is a vehicle for new businesses, partnerships and regional co-operation. We’re privileged to have a front seat at the intersection of creativity, communities and collaboration, with a unique opportunity to connect a global eco-system of partners, businesses and consumers in the MICE industry daily. Our ambition is to become a global leader made in Asia, and Asia’s top MICE company: A vision shared by our shareholders Temasek and Cuscaden Peak Investments.

But few places can give you a seat at the table where you can contribute directly to the development of the business, the cultural DNA of an emerging MNC, and the building of a company proudly made and headquartered in Singapore with global business impact. And with two lines of businesses across events and venues, we provide opportunities for you to cross over from one to the other to build range in your career.   
You don’t need to have MICE experience to work with us. We’re looking for ambitious, entrepreneurial self-starters with a strong sense of ownership, passion and curiosity, driven by our values of care, ownership, trust, passion and innovation.
