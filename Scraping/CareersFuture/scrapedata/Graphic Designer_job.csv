GRAPHIC DESIGNER,AWFULLY CHOCOLATE PTE LTD,MCF-2023-0576629,"Brand Story Back in 1998 we decided we would give the boot to fancy French pastries (which were concoctions of everything but cake) that had invaded Singapore and bring the humble cake back to its glory days. We resolved to put the cake back into cake and we would make it chocolate. It was a simple resolve and we didn’t want to complicate it. So we started a cake shop selling only one cake – a simple dark chocolate cake between layers of dark chocolate fudge. Real cake one could bite into, rich in taste yet moist and light. Not just mouthfuls of mousse or cream. Not overly sweet but something you would find yourself craving for regularly and never tire of. Since then Awfully Chocolate has grown from a one cake shop in Katong into a group of shops, cafes and restaurants bearing our love for dark chocolate, both in Singapore and overseas.",190A PANDAN LOOP 128440,Full Time,Junior Executive,2 years exp,Design,1,"['$2,900to$3,400']",Monthly,124 applications,Posted 05 Sep 2023,Closing on 05 Oct 2023,"Roles & Responsibilities

We have a strong core of expertise in collaborative human-centred design, digital transformation, and complex system innovation. We continue to add to our toolkit for design with emerging fields like behavioural insights and data analytics.
To learn more about us, visit www.thinkplaceglobal.com.
To achieve our goals, we need amazing people like you on our team.

We are looking for Designers to join our studio in Singapore. Any of the following specialties are encouraged to apply:
Design Researcher to work towards creating sustainable futures through evidence-based narratives. Background in Ethnography, Anthropology, Psychology, Sociology and/or related fields. Exposure to applying mixed methods approaches in research, analysis and report writing.
Business Designer to create strategic stories for the future. Background in Business, Commerce, Law and/or related fields. Exposure to business analytics, business model design and/or strategy development.

Designer with Industrial or Architecture background to turn powerful insights into product, services or strategic solutions which address some Singapore’s most complex challenges.
We believe that whoever will be joining us will have these core traits, found in every ThinkPlacer:
Integrity: You are unwaveringly ethical and have the highest integrity, placing emphasis on maintaining confidentiality and sensitivity in all your dealings, and on being a positive and optimistic contributor.

You can think critically about the world: You have an innate curiosity in the world and read up on topics that interest you. While you might not yet have a lot of experience, you’re interested to learn, and ask why. As a designer, you don’t just execute someone else’s brief. You can shape the brief for yourself and think through critical design decisions.
You can get creative: When the challenge is posed, you’re comfortable to throw some ideas out straight away, even if they’re lame to begin with. As you and the team get deeper into the process, you get excited as stronger concepts start to build as a result of your contributions.

We've made it our mission to reinvent the sneaker game, while doing our part for the planet. Fast-forward to [2022]— we have replanted 1.1 million trees in the Brazilian rainforest, we're a proudly certified B Corporation, and we support ambassadors made up of some of the world's most talented professional surfers and skateboarders.
