"Regional Data Analyst, Service",EPSON SINGAPORE PTE LTD,MCF-2023-0680575,"EPSON SINGAPORE PTE LTD Epson Singapore Pte Ltd was established in October 1982 as Epson Electronics (Singapore) Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Seiko Epson Corporation, Japan, with the objective of promoting the sales and marketing of Epson printers in the region. In 1987, our business scope was expanded to include the sale of electronic components and system devices. The company was subsequently renamed Epson Singapore Pte Ltd in 1988. Our product portfolio saw rapid expansion in the following years to include more IT based products such as colour inkjet printers, scanners, digital cameras, large format printers, laser printers and serial impact dot matrix printers that cater to both business and personal user environments. In recent years, we have also successfully entered the competitive market of visual instruments with highly-sophisticated LCD projectors and peripherals as well as system devices such as crystal oscillators, camera modules, D-TED colour LCD modules, ultra-compact TFT LCD modules, LCD modules, LCD drivers and ASIC/System LSI microcomputers. Then there are also the highly regarded Epson Point-Of-Sales receipt printers that have been holding a worldwide leadership position. The attainment of ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certifications in November 1997 and March 2000 respectively is a reflection as well as an affirmation of our commitment to excellent product quality and good corporate citizenship. Epson Singapore is committed to complying with the Environmental Policy established. January 2001 marked an exciting milestone in the new millennium for Epson Singapore when we were accorded the status of regional headquarters. With that move, our regional sales network was substantially enlarged to include countries in Southeast Asia with the highest economic growth potential. Most recently in April 2012, Epson Singapore was made the regional sales and service headquarters for our world-rernowned factory automation robots. Our regional product sales now cover Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Indochina and the South Asian nation of Pakistan. Epson Singapore is proud to be part of the rapid economic growth of the region that could only come about because of sound economic policies, dedicated workforces and the pervasive use of IT in government, industry, business and in homes. Epson first started life in Suwa, Japan in 1942 as ""Daiwa Kogyo"" - a company making wristwatch parts for its parent company, Seiko. The Epson name was subsequently derived in 1975 from the idea of the company being the offspring (""son"") of the innovative and successful EP-101, the world's smallest electronic printer (EP) which was created by the company in 1968. This revolutionary commercial printer was developed from the world's first digital printing timer that was specially designed for the Tokyo Olympics in 1964.","ALEXANDRA TECHNOPARK, 438B ALEXANDRA ROAD 119968",Permanent,Junior Executive,2 years exp,"Information Technology, Others",1,"['$3,800to$5,500']",Monthly,73 applications,Posted 06 Sep 2023,Closing on 06 Oct 2023,"Roles & Responsibilities
