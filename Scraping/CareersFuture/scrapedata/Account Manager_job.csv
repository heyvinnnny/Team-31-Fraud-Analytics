Business Development Manager – International,NATS SERVICES (ASIA PACIFIC) PTE. LIMITED,MCF-2023-0714965,"Our forerunner, National Air Traffic Control Services (NATCS), was established in December 1962. It covered civil ATC but liaised with the Ministry of Defence (RAF) in areas where military traffic needed to cross civilian routes. When the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was established in April 1972, NATCS became part of it and shortened its name to NATS. We recognised that as a service provider, NATS should be operated at a distance from its regulator the CAA. With that in mind, NATS was re-organised into a Companies Act company in April 1996 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the CAA. In June 1998, the Public-Private Partnership for NATS was proposed and enshrined in the Transport Act 2000. The Government chose the Airline Group (AG) as the preferred partner in March 2001 and the transaction was completed in July 2001 with the sale of 46% to the AG and the remaining 5% to staff. Although the Government retained the balance, the company was free of Treasury Control. The aviation industry downturn after 11 September 2001 led to a financial restructuring of NATS. This involved £130 million of additional investment (split between Government and Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited) to reduce borrowings. At the same time, Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited took a 4% shareholding, reducing the Airline Group’s holding to 42%. A £600 million bond issue, successfully completed in October 2003, further reduced our debt. In 2003, NATS launched its ten-year £1 billion investment programme with the announcement of a complete renewal of its radar network. Since then, we have worked with Nav Canada on a new system for Oceanic Control and became the first in Europe to establish a working Functional Airspace Block (FAB) with Irish counterparts. We also launched a Joint Venture company with the Spanish to develop the next generation of air traffic management systems for Europe.",137 TELOK AYER STREET 068602,Full Time,Manager,5 years exp,"General Management, Marketing / Public Relations, Professional Services, Telecommunications",1,"['$11,000to$18,000']",Monthly,30 applications,Posted 19 Sep 2023,Closing on 03 Oct 2023,"Roles & Responsibilities
