HIRING: Financial Advisors,ORIZAL PTE. LTD.,MCF-2023-0617819,"People-first advisory services begin with strong relationships, care and support, and not numbers on a spreadsheet. Relationships from the heart, solutions you can trust. We believe that financial solutions begin not on a sheet of paper, but from putting people first and foremost, before everything else. Discover the Orizal difference now.","CLAYMORE PLAZA, 6 CLAYMORE HILL 229571",Full Time,Fresh/entry level,,"Banking and Finance, Customer Service, Insurance, Sales / Retail",1,"['$3,000to$10,000']",Monthly,1 application,Posted 15 Sep 2023,Closing on 15 Oct 2023,"Roles & Responsibilities
Orizal is a group of financial advisors representing a suite of different financial services providers, enabling us to provide solutions; not products that adequately cover our clients’ specific needs at every stage in life.
We are looking for a Financial Advisor with a strong heart and desire to serve, to join our ambitious goal to deliver people-first financial solutions to our clients.

Orizal was founded by 2 industry veterans in the financial advisory industry in 2019, bringing together over a combined 30 years of experience at the onset. To date, 22 advisors - from new advisors to seasoned industry practitioners - have joined us from all walks of life because of our insistent approach to guide them at every step of their career.

At Orizal, we constantly put the spotlight on people, not the numbers.
That means we don’t want you to push products; but rather, provide adaptive solutions to each individual client that you get to meet, so as to build a fulfilling, rewarding and sustainable career that is a lifelong experience.
We are a young company, but already with a proven track record - our advisors have won multiple awards (like the much coveted ApfinSa and Million Dollar Round Table [MDRT]) consecutively since joining Orizal.

We’re confident that you can be next up there, receiving those awards.
We know that the hearsay is that financial advisory sounds like a “pushy” job, that “it’s hard to succeed”, and that “it’s a tough business”.

That’s because it is - if you don’t have the right environment to grow, and the right partners to help you grow. That’s Orizal.
We are actively recruiting people who are self-motivated and keen to build your own business, earning based on your hard work. If you are someone who is self-motivated, enjoys working in a collaborative team environment and keen to do meaningful work to help people, we want you!

What role(s) can I expect to handle?
Orizal offers you flexible options to grow your career right from the start. We let you choose the path that you want to take in your career, and we focus our efforts in helping you get there.
Want to eventually have and grow your own team? Our management path helps you to develop and hone your leadership skills
Want to just do financial advisory? We’ll place all our efforts to help you sharpen your advisory abilities, and give you ample directions to thrive
Something else? Our team is always open to new suggestions to grow together
What sets us apart?
We’re serious when we say that we aggressively invest in our people. Our own marketing efforts feature each and every one of our advisors, and put the focus on their individual stories / branding, which is a novel first in Singapore.

Our marketing and branding efforts to promote you

Day in the life of a financial advisor series: bit.ly/3Mcjxfw
Our social media efforts that focus on our people (not products): bit.ly/3zruq5t

Proven systems and mentorship
We leverage our industry knowledge and experience (over 30 years worth) to shortcut what works and throw out what doesn’t. Right from the get go, we offer intensive guidance and mentorship with our own in-house methodologies that:
Show you how to generate referrals and sales in a non-salesy way
Show you how to adequately serve a client to completely cover them in the event of any unfortunately life events
Show you the path to create not just a solid career, but a holistic life experience that balances work, life, family and everything in between.
What support will you get?
If you are new to financial advisory
We’ll take care of all your onboarding expenses (like licensing as a Certified Financial Planner)
We’ll provide patient, one-on-one training on every aspect of financial advisory to guide you from start to seasoned veteran
We’ll help you to avoid potential pitfalls in the industry to speed up your success in the field
If you are already familiar with the industry
We’ll work with you to uncover obstacles standing in your way
We’ll provide you with dedicated administrative support to handle enquiries, cases, and everything else
We’ll share our own experience and knowledge to help you go further
And much, much more.
The Orizal family culture
At Orizal, we believe life doesn’t start and end with work. Work puts food on the table, but what we do after counts, equally.

Whether you’re a dedicated mother, aunt, traveler, husband or wife with commitments besides work, we’re all in to help make your schedule work.

In short, you get complete control and freedom to plan how, where and when you work.
And when you’re ready, the Orizal family is always there. With a strong focus on unity and togetherness, we’re building a familial environment situated at the heart of work.
