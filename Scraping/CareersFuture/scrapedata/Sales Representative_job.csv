News flash: Wi-Fi and data are about to get even faster.

Demand for speed and quality has been on a constant rise as we enter a digital era where we need and crave for more bandwidth.

Expected to be about 2.5x faster than its predecessor, Wi-Fi 6 is not just a one-time nitro boost. We are more likely to reap the effects of its benefits more over time.

And of course, data needs to move in sync as well. Introducing 5G, topping over 4G in terms of speed and functionality. Up to 100x faster, and the ability to handle more devices with its enhanced capacity.

Conclusion: work your house towards a PHD ;)

We no longer live in the era of lock-and-key doors and pulley curtains.
We may even be looking at doors that unlock with retina scans, and curtains that react to sunlight in future.
Anything’s possible!

And with the increased demand for connectivity, we need people who can help to get this across to the masses. That’s where we step in.

Here at Catalyst Marketing, we believe that businesses require Sales & Marketing to flourish and excel.

It gives that jolt of energy and generates greater power as more resources are pumped into it. Time, people and skills.

- You find this ad, and give it a read.
- Decide to give it a try and apply.
- We drop a call and say hi.
