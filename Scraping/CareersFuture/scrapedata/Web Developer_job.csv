Over the years, it gradually became the corporate headquarters of all the related companies and provided back-end support to Sheng Siong Supermarket. Functions carried out at CMM include purchasing, marketing, administration, finance, information technology and human resource. In 2008, housebrand products were developed for and launched in Sheng Siong’s chain stores, beginning with staples such as rice, cooking oil, sugar, salt, canned food and non-food necessities such as kitchen towels, bathroom tissue and so on. In June 2009, CMM, together with Sheng Siong Supermarket, announced plans to build their new HQ cum Distribution Centre at Mandai Link Road (to replace their current facility at 3000 Marsiling Road) in Singapore, with an investment of $65 million. The new Distribution Centre will be built on 2.32 hectares (or 249,722 sq ft) of land awarded by JTC Corporation, with a lease of 30 + 30 years. Its land size is about twice that of the current warehouse (120,328 sq ft). The new built-up area will be approximately 543,000 sq ft, about 4 times bigger than the current HQ. The current facility was acquired from an electronics manufacturer, so it was not customised to suit the needs of CMM and its related companies.

At that point in time, skating lessons were popular but most lessons were only held at East Coast Park. With this, Inlinex recognized that there was an opportunity to reach out to learners by bringing skating lessons closer to homes. With this mission in mind, a van was acquired along with 10 pairs of skates, gears and helmets. After considering several locations, Inlinex finally found a space behind Blk 8 Joo Seng Rd and started teaching skating lessons on weekends there. Soon the small space was bustling with people and Inlinex had to purchase more skates and equipment to cater to the growing numbers. Armed with more skates and equipment, Inlinex was now able to reach out to bigger groups and open up a few more locations. Inlinex opened up skating lessons at Tanglin Halt and Damai Rd to reach out to more people all over Singapore. Inlinex knew that opening more locations was vital to their continued expansion and to capture more of the market share dominated by bigger companies. A second van was acquired together with more skating equipment and Inlinex started offering skating lessons at Bedok Reservoir Park, Punggol Park and Choa Chu Kang Park. Inlinex stepped up its recruitment process to find reliable and committed instructors. Instructor training was conducted to get all our instructors internationally certified, sometimes even after working hours to cater to the instructor’s day jobsAfter one year, Inlinex had taught more than 400 students.In 2009, Inlinex registered into Sports Education Program (SEP) by Singapore Sports Council (SSC) and started conducting lessons in Schools. In order to keep abreast with the rules of SEP, all instructors had to attend National Coach Accreditation Program Theory by SSC. As the post exam period came, Inlinex managed to become skating lesson vendor for various schools including ACS Barker, Victoria School and many more. This proved to be the turnng point of Inlinex.
