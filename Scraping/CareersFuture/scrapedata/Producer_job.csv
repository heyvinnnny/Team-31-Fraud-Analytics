We’re on the lookout for someone with the ultimate balance of organisation and creativity, to lead our teams of designers on some challenging and exciting graphic design, in-person events, and video production projects.
This is a role for a detail-oriented digital producer with client-facing experience
You will be responsible for the end-to-end delivery of small to large scale creative projects
Employed in Singapore on a full time basis. We ask that you’re in the office 4 times a week and the days are yours to pick each week.
You’ll be mostly working with briefs, storyboards, and client docs in Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Slides, Meet).
Familiarity with Adobe Creative Cloud is a plus, we can get you up to speed if not.
In our team of around 50, you’ll report to our Head of Business assigning tasks and managing workflows with our team of graphic designers, video editors, and animators.
A creative side
You’ll join our team of 6 producers across our Melbourne and Singapore offices, who all have a keen eye, interest and background in design, production, or creative arts. You’ll work with our Creative Directors, Art Directors and Designers to take client briefs and develop a creative response. You’ll brief our designers and work closely with them throughout production, presenting our work to clients and discussing feedback and changes, until final delivery.

Rolling up your sleeves
Like every good producer, you’ll probably be a bit of a jack of all trades, and won’t mind diving in to help source a great music track or help a designer out with a quick text change.

Organise like Kondo
Our producers are the keepers of timelines, budgets, milestones, and daily project tasks, and an average producer will have 3-4 projects on the go at any given time, depending on the complexity. We need someone who’s organised and thrives on being busy and keeping pace with our clients.

You’ll have the opportunity to work across design, animation, and video projects for some huge moments with big companies. We’ve worked across the world since the start, but in 2021 we took the plunge and opened our first office outside of Australia, so if you take on the role you’ll be working with colleagues in Melbourne and Singapore to deliver projects around the world.

We’re based out of a private office inside WeWork for all the perks and a great community atmosphere and we put a big focus on a good quality work experience with snacks, great coffee and a dog-friendly office. We also provide a flexible work from anywhere policy by agreement for 20 days each year.
