Want to develop IoT enabled autonomous environmental sensors?

Job Title: Mechatronics Engineer
Location: Singapore
Duration: Fulltime
Hiring Manager: Dr Lars-Henrik Skjolding, CTO

Aprisium Pte. Ltd.

Aprisium’s mission is to transform contamination management by providing innovative solutions that empower industries and communities to effectively measure, monitor and help mitigate contamination risks, safeguarding the environment and public health. By adhering to the principles of advancing technology, environmental stewardship, customer-centric approach, collaborations, and partnerships, we envision a future where contamination risks are proactively managed, ecosystems are protected, and communities thrive in a healthier environment.
Contamination is a global problem and companies are paying huge fines (for example, just one company in the UK paid 91million pounds as fine for causing contamination with their discharges) apart from tarnishing their brands and investor image, but the current method of detection involves collecting and sending samples to labs and awaiting results in 3-15 days, a predominantly post-mortem exercise. Damage done!

Aprisium is delivering on-site-deployed detection and monitoring devices with rapid results (20-60mins) and sending live data and insights to customer browsers helping customers proactively manage and address their contamination concerns.

Job Summary:

Aprisium is seeking a highly motivated and detail-oriented experienced Mechatronics Engineer to join our team. As a Mechatronics Engineer, you will work closely with our CTO and chemistry team to develop, design, and test innovative mechatronic systems. You will be involved in every stage of the product development process, from research and design to manufacturing and testing.

Key Responsibilities:

• Design, model, and simulate mechatronic systems that integrate mechanical components, sensors, actuators, and control electronics for electrochemical applications.

• Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define project requirements and specifications for mechatronic systems.

• Develop prototypes and conduct experiments to validate and refine designs, optimizing performance and efficiency.

• Implement control algorithms and programming logic to ensure the seamless interaction of mechanical and electrical components.

• Integrate and test sensors, actuators, and electronic components, troubleshooting and resolving any technical issues that arise.

• Conduct feasibility studies and cost analysis for new mechatronic technologies and components.

• Stay up-to-date with advancements in mechatronics, automation, and related fields to identify potential opportunities for innovation and improvement.

• Document design processes, experiments, and results thoroughly, maintaining clear and organized records.

• Ensure compliance with safety standards and best practices during all stages of mechatronic system development.

Requirements:

· Graduated with Poly, Bachelor's or Master's degree program in Mechatronics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or a related field.

· Hands-on experience with mechatronic systems, including sensors, actuators, and control systems.

· Knowledge of mechatronic system design and development.

· Knowledge of software to develop user interfaces and ensure proper communication between hardware and software components.

· Familiarity with programming languages such as C++, Python, Rust, or Matlab.

· Excellent analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills.

· Ability to work independently and as part of a high-performance team.

· Strong attention to detail and ability to follow through on tasks.
