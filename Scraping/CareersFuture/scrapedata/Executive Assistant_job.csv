A TYPICAL DAY
I am usually in the office by 7.30am. As an individual who is detail oriented while dealing with figures and people this is key so that everything is processed by 8.00am, so I am able to pick up any potential issues before all employees arrive at work. My team and I work from a shared inbox where work is categorised to individuals or teams, so this is the first point of call. We could have over 50 emails to clear per day as our shared inbox consists of staff absence which needs recording on our HR system. I work closely with the academic deputies and heads to coordinate on training and development courses for our people.
During my lunch break at 12.00pm, I often head to the school’s gym for a quick workout. After my lunch break, I receive an email about the resignation of a member of staff and it happens to be an overseas recruited employee. With this in mind, I need to quickly process the tax clearance and off boarding process for the employee as the timeline is tight. Towards the end of the business day, I process the salary reimbursement for our Cover Supervisor who comes in on an ad-hoc basis. Being a senior executive, I also support members of my team on HR related matters. By the end of the day, I would have completed most of my daily operational tasks and ready for new challenges each brand new day.

At least 3 years of relevant HR experience
Knowledge of Singapore employment act and HR-related government regulatory act
