Associate Product Manager,FABRICA ROBOTICS PTE.

Fabrica AI is creating a future where ideating and developing a robot for any task takes days, not years. We believe that by training end to end controls in simulation with reinforcement learning and above that iterating hardware designs, we can automate the whole development process. At the current stage, the most important resource is a large fleet of robots to validate our approaches for our AI system and to collect data. This would help keep us grounded in reality.
To start building up the fleet, we invented an automatic tile grouting robot that boosts productivity by 5x and are piloting it on construction sites in Singapore managed by Woh Hup, BHCC, Gin Chia, Soilbuild, and Dragages. This should correspond to about 30% of the Singaporean market. We have early leads in the US and Europe as well. Tile grouting is the process of filling up the gaps between tiles after the tiles have been laid. Grouting is part of virtually every construction project and a highly laborious process, is considered one of the most physically damaging tasks resulting in tilers’ knees and back issues, and thus quality issues would also arise. We invented a patent pending robot that is able to automatically grout and clean tile gaps with only a press of a button. The operators would only need to reload grout and water.

We have also pitched at the Built Environment Demo Day 2022 organised by BCA as part of the International Built Environment Week (IBEW) and won the Rising Star Award. IBEW has drawn more than 10,000 individuals from over 100 countries.

Recently, we had a Presentation to Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7034394354731413504
We have also raised 850k USD from Hoxton Ventures to enable our development in not just our tile grouting robots but also other forms of construction automation.
