Position Overview:
The Asia Private Investments (PI) Team consists of Directors and Analysts/Associates based in Singapore and Beijing. PI includes venture capital, private equity, and other illiquid investment opportunities across all Asia-Pacific markets. For the avoidance of doubt, the focus is on investment into private funds and not individual deals, though the team does help with coinvestment opportunities to a lesser extent.
The Investment Analyst (IA) will gain experience in two core functions: (1) portfolio management through working with our clients and (2) investment research by meeting and evaluating private investment fund managers in Asia. IAs will build deep expertise in Asian private investments in addition to broader context of global private markets through internal team forums and by working on global client portfolios.
IAs will work closely with investment directors to provide investment due diligence and market research, analysis, and investment recommendations to our clients. The role involves quantitative analysis as well as a strong qualitative component. Alongside investment directors, IAs will meet senior executives from PE and VC firms as part of our research coverage of the Asian PI markets. Such meetings form the basis of our firm’s PI manager opinions and thematic investment views in Asia.
Having both strong oral and written communication skills is very important, as IAs are responsible for describing market conditions and relaying investment recommendations through written reports and in-person meetings. Clients served by the Asia PI team include large global clients where we are responsible for managing the clients’ Asia PI exposure as part of a global team of colleagues; and Asia-based clients, where the team is responsible for building a global PI portfolio.
This position that we are currently hiring for will be based in our Singapore office.

Job Responsibilities:
Meet with and evaluate PI fund managers and write post-meeting commentaries
Complete in-depth due diligence on opportunities that we are recommending to CA clients
Ad-hoc analysis to support our thematic investment views
Work with investment directors to build and manage private investment portfolios for clients
Prepare investment memos and client presentation materials related to investment manager recommendations, portfolio updates, and other thematic discussion topics customized for clients
Synthesize firm research and highlight interesting new private investment ideas and maintain a customized investment pipeline for each client
Gather and analyze clients’ historical performance and company exposure data with the aim of developing a strategy for their private investments portfolio, understanding portfolio geographical and sector exposures, and identifying performance drivers/detractors
Serve as an interface between the Asia PI team and clients/colleagues for questions on Asia PI fund managers and market views
Other duties as assigned, as earned, and as the group evolves
Skills:
Demonstrated interest in private investments including venture capital, private equity, private credit, etc.
Familiarity with the private investment manager landscape would be a bonus but not a pre-requisite
Strong writing ability and oral communication skills
Strong analytical skills
Shows good initiative and a curiosity to learn
Excellent organizational skills, keen eye for detail, ability to prioritize and work on multiple projects simultaneously and under tight deadlines
Must have a strong command of the English language; business fluency in Mandarin, Japanese, or Korean is a plus
Must be proficient in Microsoft Excel
A demonstrated ability to work independently and as part of a team
A desire and capability for periodic travel
Qualifications:
Bachelor’s degree (any major) with a record of high academic achievement
Individuals with 0-2 years of work experience are welcomed to apply
