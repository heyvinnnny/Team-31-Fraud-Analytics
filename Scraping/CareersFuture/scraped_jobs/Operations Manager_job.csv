The principal activity of PERTAPIS is the running of welfare projects which are designed to address some of the social problems faced by the community. These projects include the running of welfare homes, providing social support for the needy families and educational services. Our Journey PERTAPIS was formed in 1969 by a group of young aspiring Muslims who believed in the importance of moral and religious education in order to build a strong resilient self in youth. In the days of kampung living, the community would come together to help ease the burden of families in need. For most, this did not change even after modernisation and families moved into flats. They carried on that kampung spirit by forming ‘block committees’ and organising activities involving social interaction, community bonding and welfare support. From its humble beginnings, PERTAPIS, as a ‘self-help organisation’ is today an approved charitable organisation under the Charities Act with Institution of Public Character (IPC) status and has helped more than 3000 families in need.",,"Permanent, Full Time",Manager,3 years exp,Social Services,1,"['$3,500to$4,100']",Monthly,23 applications,Posted 18 Sep 2023,Closing on 18 Oct 2023,"Roles & Responsibilities
