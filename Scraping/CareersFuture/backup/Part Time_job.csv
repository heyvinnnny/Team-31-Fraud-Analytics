Area Manager,YOSHINOYA (S) PTE LTD,MCF-2023-0628497,"YOSHINOYA is the oldest and largest chain of beef bowl restaurants with over 1200 outlets around the world. It was founded by Mr Eikichi Matsuda and named after his hometown in Yoshino-Cho, Osaka. The story of Yoshinoya began in 1899 with a small shop in Nihonbashi Fish Market selling Beef Bowl (or Gyūdon in Japanese). Its secret recipe broth seasoned with savoury herbs and spices together with large, sweet onions, served on a bowl of fluffy Japanese rice, presented a healthy and tasty meal to the fishermen and fish market mongers. Due to their busy and hectic schedules, the fishermen and fish market mongers barely had time to eat. At Yoshinoya, they could step into a bar-like area, place their order at the centre of the bar and receive their bowl soon after. Eating the beef bowl was very convenient as it could also be held in one hand and eaten whilst standing up. The word soon spread about Yoshinoya's beef bowl and it gained huge popularity among the working class. Over the years, Yoshinoya has rapidly expanded around the world, to various countries including Japan, USA, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Singapore.

It is home to Malaysia's oldest Musang King tree. During every durian season, fresh durians are picked daily from 5am to 7am. They are sorted and graded.
