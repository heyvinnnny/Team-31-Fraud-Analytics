Rollite™ Rollscreens effectively shields out the sun, providing interiors with cool, shaded relief from exterior heat, whilst maintaining visual connectivity and airflow with the external environment. The idea of using fiberglass screens as an internal shading system was timely and ideal, as the 1980s saw a rising prevalence of high-rise buildings clad in glass curtain walls. To complement modern architectural language, the fiberglass screen was further improved by being integrated with a compact and reliable internal roller assembly, which allows the length of the fabric to be stored within a minimal space, out of sight. Thereafter, it was registered under the trademark of Rollite™ Rollscreens in Singapore and overseas by Sunscreen Singapore, the exclusive manufacturer of Rollite™ Rollscreensand Skylight Shading Systems.
