The scheme aimed to elevate teaching and teachers’ lives through the recruitment and management of TAs, as they assist the teachers administratively and operationally. The success of the scheme has since made EHC one of the most credible education manpower service providers amongst others, where it has been trusted with staffing within the realms of administration, ICT, laboratories, sports coaching and even management of the schools. Today, EHC serves more than 200 Singapore schools, presenting itself as one of the principal Education Human Resource solutions providers in Singapore. Beyond the schools, EHC has made its foray into other government sectors, and had clinched multiple contracts to provide manpower services for the government ministries and organisations, such as the Ministry of Home Affairs (Commercial Affairs Department), Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance (VITAL), The State Courts, Singapore Workforce Development Agency and Energy Market Authority. EHC has also explored business opportunities to the private sector within the education realm. EHC has deployed staff to international schools and institutions, which include ISS International School, Hollandse School Singapore, Tien Hsia Language Centre and others. Over the past 3 years, EHC’s total headcount within the government organisations (Non-MOE) and private sector grew by more than 300%, representing its broadening market presence. Even as EHC continues to diversify its business, it never strays away from its founding philosophy and philanthropy. EHC has been and always will be striving to maintain at least 60% of its services to the schools in Singapore, so as to give back to schools and communities, where it shapes destinies through job creation, resolving unemployment and off-loading admin duties of teachers.",,Contract,Non-executive,2 years exp,Admin / Secretarial,1,"['$1,800to$2,000']",Monthly,31 applications,Posted 11 Sep 2023,Closing on 11 Oct 2023,"Roles & Responsibilities
