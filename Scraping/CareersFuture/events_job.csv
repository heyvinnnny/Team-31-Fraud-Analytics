We’re looking for a bundle of energy who’s independent, reliable, a self-starter, a go-getter, a problem solver, and a doer.

If that doesn’t mean a thing to you, let’s break it down in practical terms.

We have lots of enquiries, so we need someone to follow up, work out a proposal and quotation, and then close the deal.
Once we’re awarded a project (could be physical, virtual or hybrid events), we need someone to work closely with the client to ensure that the project is executed perfectly (well, nearly, since absolute perfection is just a concept).
While working on the project, you’ll face many problems. That’s where your problem-solving skills come in.
Sometimes you’re working in a team, sometimes you’re alone, and sometimes we’re working from home, and that’s why we need someone that’s reliable and independent.
We’d love it if you had some experience in events management (physical, virtual & hybrid) and account management so that you can hit the ground running and help us hold the fort.
If you are that someone, we’d like to speak with you!
